      <p>
        MindBloom is used by parents and guardians on behalf of their children. We collect the
        smallest amount of information needed to run the activities and your account.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Parent account: email address and, optionally, your name.</li>
          <li>
            Child profile: a nickname (not a full legal name), an age group, an avatar emoji and
            activity preferences you choose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Activity data: which activities were completed, mood check-in emojis, routine ticks and
            badges earned.
          </li>
          <li>Consultation bookings: the contact details you enter when requesting a session.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What we do not collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not ask children for their real name, school, address or photographs.</li>
          <li>We do not ask for medical records or diagnoses.</li>
          <li>There is no chat, messaging or public profile anywhere in MindBloom.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Who can access it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Only the signed-in parent account that created a child profile can read its data.</li>
          <li>
            Access is enforced by database row-level security rules, not only by the interface, so
            one family can never read another family's data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Administrators can see consultation bookings in order to schedule them; they do not have
            access to children's profiles, moods or activity history.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Deleting your data</h2>
        <p>
          A parent can delete any child profile at any time from the Parent Dashboard. Deleting a
          child profile permanently removes that child's activity history, mood check-ins, routines
          and badges.
        </p>

          practices; it is not a statement of certified compliance with any specific regulation.
